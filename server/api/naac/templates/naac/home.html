            <p>India has one of the largest and diverse education systems in the world. Privatization, widespread
                expansion,
                increased autonomy and introduction of Programmes in new and emerging areas have improved access to
                higher
                education. At the same time, it has also led to widespread concern on the quality and relevance of the
                higher education. To address these concerns, the National Policy on Education (NPE, 1986) and the
                Programme
                of Action (PoA, 1992) spelt out strategic plans for the policies, advocated the establishment of an
                independent National accreditation agency. Consequently, the National Assessment and Accreditation
                Council
                (NAAC) was established in 1994 as an autonomous institution of the University Grants Commission (UGC)
                with
                its Head Quarter in Bengaluru. The mandate of NAAC as reflected in its vision statement is in making
                quality
                assurance an integral part of the functioning of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs).</p>

            <p>The NAAC functions through its General Council (GC) and Executive Committee (EC) comprising educational
                administrators, policy makers and senior academicians from a cross-section of Indian higher education
                system. The Chairperson of the UGC is the President of the GC of the NAAC, the Chairperson of the EC is
                an
                eminent academician nominated by the President of GC (NAAC). The Director is the academic and
                administrative
                head of NAAC and is the member-secretary of both the GC and the EC. In addition to the statutory bodies
                that
                steer its policies and core staff to support its activities NAAC is advised by the advisory and
                consultative
                committees constituted from time to time.</p>
